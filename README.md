All the examples I use in the 2020 BC High Robotics Summer Course are contained in this repository.

## Useful Information

Each file's naming scheme gives information about its contents:

**(Prefix)(Number)_(Identifier)**

### Prefix:  
> P: Project. Something I will work through and have everyone program.  

> E: Example. Something I will use as an example, but may be prohibitively long or complicated to work through with everyone.

### Number:  
> Numbers exist to keep a logical order.

### Identifier:  
> A descriptive name that describes the project/example's lesson.
